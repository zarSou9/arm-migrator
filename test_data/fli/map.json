  "description": "The project of creating value-aligned AI is perhaps one of the most important things we will ever do. However, there are open and often neglected questions regarding what is exactly entailed by 'beneficial AI.' Value alignment is the project of one day creating beneficial AI and has been expanded outside of its usual technical context to reflect and model its truly interdisciplinary nature. For value-aligned AI to become a reality, we need to not only solve intelligence, but also the ends to which intelligence is aimed and the social/political context, rules, and policies in and through which this all happens. This landscape synthesizes a variety of AI safety research agendas along with other papers in AI, machine learning, ethics, governance, and AI safety, robustness, and beneficence research. It lays out what technical research threads can help us to create beneficial AI, and describes how these many topics tie together.",

          "description": "It is often desirable to retain some form of meaningful human control (<a href=\"http://futureoflife.org/data/documents/research_priorities.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Russell et al. 2015</a>), whether this means a human in the loop or on the loop (<a href=\"http://www2.cs.siu.edu/~hexmoor/CV/PUBLICATIONS/JOURNALS/JETAI-08/final.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Hexmoor et al. 2009</a>, <a href=\"https://hci.cs.uwaterloo.ca/faculty/elaw/cs889/reading/automation/sheridan.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Parasuraman et al. 2000</a>), yet the system should have a clear expectation of whether or not the human is sufficiently experienced, skilled, and ready for what it will ask of them (<a href=\"http://cvrr.ucsd.edu/eshed/papers/humansTIV.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Ohn-Bar and Trivedi 2016</a>). It has been argued that very general, capable, autonomous AI systems will often be subject to effects that increase the difficulty of maintaining meaningful human control (<a href=\"http://selfawaresystems.files.wordpress.com/2008/01/nature_of_self_improving_ai.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Omohundro 2007</a>, <a href=\"http://www.nickbostrom.com/superintelligentwill.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Bostrom 2012</a>, <a href=\"https://global.oup.com/academic/product/superintelligence-9780199678112\" target=\"_blank\">Bostrom 2014</a>, <a href=\"https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/technological-singularity\" target=\"_blank\">Shanahan 2015</a>).<br><br>For advanced agents, most goals would actually put the agent at odds with human interests by default, giving it incentives to deceive or manipulate its human operators and to resist interventions designed to change or debug its behavior (<a href=\"https://global.oup.com/academic/product/superintelligence-9780199678112\" target=\"_blank\">Bostrom 2014</a>). This is because if an AI system is selecting the actions that best allow it to complete a given task, then avoiding conditions that prevent the system from continuing to pursue the task is a natural consequence and can manifest as an emergent subgoal (<a href=\"http://selfawaresystems.files.wordpress.com/2008/01/nature_of_self_improving_ai.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Omohundro 2007</a>, <a href=\"http://www.nickbostrom.com/superintelligentwill.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Bostrom 2012</a>). That could become problematic, however, if one wishes to repurpose the system, to deactivate it, or to significantly alter its decision-making process; such a system would be rational to avoid these changes. Following a broader convention and understanding within the artificial intelligence and computer science domains, self-control and reliable decision making fall under validation while operator control falls in the present section. If methods of alignment and control don't scale with how the intelligence of the system scales, a widening gap of potentially dangerous behavior will appear (<a href=\"https://medium.com/ai-control/scalable-ai-control-7db2436feee7\" target=\"_blank\">Christiano 2015f</a>). Advanced systems that do not have such issues are termed corrigible systems (<a href=\"http://aaai.org/ocs/index.php/WS/AAAIW15/paper/viewFile/10124/10136\" target=\"_blank\">Soares et al. 2015</a>).<br><br>The possibility of rapid, sustained self-improvement has been highlighted by past and current projects on the future of AI as potentially valuable to the project of maintaining reliable control in the long term. Technical work would likely lead to enhanced understanding of the likelihood of such phenomena, and the nature, risks, and overall outcomes associated with different conceived variants (<a href=\"https://www.aaai.org/Organization/Panel/panel-note.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Horvitz and Selman 2009</a>, <a href=\"https://ai100.stanford.edu/sites/default/files/ai100_framing_memo_0.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Horvitz 2014</a>). Theoretical and forecasting work on intelligence explosion and superintelligence have been done before, but require regular updating and improved methods (<a href=\"http://consc.net/papers/singularity.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Chalmers 2010</a>, <a href=\"https://global.oup.com/academic/product/superintelligence-9780199678112\" target=\"_blank\">Bostrom 2014</a>). Yet other architectures seek situations that seem unconstrained within some given time horizon (<a href=\"http://math.mit.edu/~freer/papers/PhysRevLett_110-168702.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Wissner-Gross and Freer 2013</a>), which present additional control challenges.

Even if all the technical issues surrounding the creation of an artificial general intelligence (AGI) are solved, we will still face deeply challenging ethical questions that will have tremendous consequences for Earth-originating intelligent life.This is what is meant when it is said that We must do philosophy on a deadline.<br><br>Given this goal, ethics  can be seen as a lens through which to view safe AI design, and also as a cognitive architecture to be instantiated in AI by either making AIs ethical reasoners, ethical decision makers, and/or both (machine ethics). Ethics can be developed, practiced, and embodied by AI researchers and their collaborators, and can also be seen as a discipline through which we can guide AI research and adjudicate its moral impacts in the world. There is an ongoing debate surrounding whether the best path forward for generating ethical AI is one of machine ethics through bottom-up and/or top-down approaches, a project of broad AI safety which seeks out corrigibility, docility, alignment, and security, some combination of the two, or maybe even something else. What is more certain, though, is that AI promises to produce and make relevant both age-old and novel moral questions through areas such as algorithmic bias, technological disemployment, autonomous weapons, privacy, big data systems, possible phenomenal states in machines, and potentially even superintelligence and beyond.",

For illustrative purposes of population ethics,  the Repugnant Conclusion states that, For any possible population of at least ten billion people, all with a very high quality of life, there must be some much larger imaginable population whose existence, if other things are equal, would be better even though its members have lives that are barely worth living (Parfit 1984).<br><br>In the long-term, powerful AI systems may be able to influence and manipulate human population and our birth rates.

It is thus something to be practiced by both AI designers and potentially even AIs. It is a topic rarely covered by ethicists and AI engineers in the context of value alignment and there is thus little to no research about it. In the short term, it might be the case that its relevance is low as the ethical impacts of metaethical disagreements for normative theory and applied ethics are limited in the world. In the long term, however, if superintelligence is created and the cosmic endowment can be optimized to some end then metaethics becomes crucially important. We can understand the importance of metaethics here as metaphysical and epistemological issues regarding what beneficial intelligence entails. To what end should we aim intelligence and why? This can be captured as debates between moral realist and moral anti-realist positions, which consequently have said metaphysical and epistemological implications in ethics and thus in what it means to be a beneficial AI. One cannot continue with the project of generating beneficial AI without a clear understanding of beneficial. This question largely exists in the domain of metaethics.<br><br>This may be the most difficult form of ethics to develop in machines as it is the most abstract, but more technical research is needed on abstract concept representations in AI. If metaethics is instantiated or developed in AI then AI will not only be ethical decision makers, but also ethical reasoners as well. This would be a necessary but not sufficient condition for creating beneficial AGIs and thus represents one of the most crucial parts to long-term value alignment. Answering the question of what is good and valuable in the world and why? is an interdependently necessary part of value alignment and may be one of few things left to contemplate once intelligence is solved.<br><br>Here are some important questions to consider here: What are the impacts of specific metaethical theories? How much would some position change our current paths on value alignment? How would it change technical AI research? What probabilities am I assigning to different metaethical theories? How does the interplay of uncertainty and potential impact of specific positions affect how we ought to proceed with value alignment?",

Given this uncertainty, there is consequently much uncertainty about the appropriate application of normative ethical theories. As long as there is metaethical uncertainty, there will be uncertainty in normative ethics as it is downstream of and its success is contingent upon true metaethics.<br><br>Ideally one would want to determine if there are any methods approaching objectivity for enumerating, generating, or ranking value systems. This kind of metaethics explores more first-principles approaches to ethics. Questions about the most proper thing for one to do when they're uncertain about what ought to be done in the first place arise (MacAskill 2014, Tegmark 2015). Figuring out what norms govern uncertainty about normative claims, and how can uncertainty about moral claims can be resolved are both open areas of investigation (MacAskill 2014). Answers to these questions are reasonable baseline proxies to help reason about what sorts of conclusions the operators would come to if they had much more knowledge and much more time to think and develop (Soares and Fallenstein 2014a, Bostrom 2014). These problems are largely still in the realm of philosophy rather than computer science, but interdisciplinary approaches would seem to be be called for in order to explore different angles on this problem.",

Regarding the latter, understanding moral psychology provides a framework for understanding the conceptual structure(s) which guides and constrains human social behavior. It thus functions to specify and/or predict how humans will interact with certain kinds of AI systems and what features said AI systems must contain in order to properly function in relation to human moral psychology. If moral psychology is ignored, we risk generating AIs which feel unethical or adversarial as they violate or come into conflict our moral psychology even if it is the case that they are morally superior or far more benevolent than ourselves. In terms of preference aggregation, moral psychology may also help identify general trends and preferences that are more or less hard-wired across humanity. This may  assist in narrowing the space of general human preferences and moral attitudes. It can also provide insight into ethics in general by identifying where our actual preferences are not aligned with our posited ethical philosophy or what we think we ought to prefer or value.

This is due to the potential computational intractability of accounting for complex systems and large amounts of causes and conditions that lead to various outcomes. In response to this, parameters can be set to limit the extent to which an AI dedicates resources to computing possible outcomes and their likelihoods.This can be done through intelligent heuristics that set rational boundaries for time spent on reflection and may thus help with cutting down on computational complexity (Wallach 2007). Furthermore, some forms of consequentialism may be more viable than others, such as two-level utilitarianism and rule utilitarianism as they are the formalization of commitment to, at least in part, higher level principles and generalized rules that can be shared and learned relatively easily. When an agent is able to act or participate in morality based on previously agreed upon or discovered and formulated rules or maxims, said agent cuts down on computational requirements by avoiding the need to continuously take into account all relevant and even possible consequences of actions in new situations.<br><br>There will be cases where purely consequentialist accounts of what ought to be done will be far more tractable, such as with big data driven bioethics in resource limited contexts. In the end, it may also be the case that some mixture of virtue ethics, consequentialism, deontological ethics, and unknown ethical structures will be ideal as they are each more or less computationally efficient in different domains. There has been very little research regarding the computational viability of and means of computerizing top-down approaches (Wallach 2007).",

While this appears to be an attractive and simple solution, there are open questions regarding the epistemic and computational feasibility of such a normative framework. Given that there are many possible forms of utilitarianism, some types, coupled with useful heuristics, probabilistic reasoning, and optimized inductive and deductive reasoning, will be more or less tractable than other forms. Furthermore, defining and effectively measuring which experiential states count as valuable and which count as unvaluable is notoriously difficult. More research is needed on the subject (Wallach 2009).<br><br>In the long term, if a purely utilitarian AI ethics is achieved then we will need to be mindful of the urgency for AIs to explain calculated decisions in ways that are sensitive to human morality, moral psychology, and concepts. If we are unable to follow the utility calculus of an advanced AI, its ethical decisions may seem strange, foreign, and even unethical to us when they are really rational, wise, and morally benevolent. This may even moreso be the case if the causal implications of a proposed action are unclear to humans. A potential resolution to such a situation would be to develop an AI-human-repertoire where AI systems can explain to us, as a parent explains the necessity of certain decisions/actions to a child, the calculus and causal impacts in terms that we can understand.",

          "description": "Given even verified software, environmental assumptions can easily not hold in the real world, or the requirements that led to the specification may be faulty or lacking. These sort of specification errors are quite usual in the world of software verification, where it is often observed that writing correct specifications can be more difficult than writing correct code (<a href=\"http://futureoflife.org/data/documents/research_priorities.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Russell et al. 2015</a>). Validation is the process of ensuring that a system that meets its formal requirements does not have undesirable behaviors or consequences. It is asking the question \"Did I build (or ask for) the right system?\".<br><br>Ensuring that the formal requirements, the specification, considers all relevant dynamics, and will be beneficial and desirable, does not actually fit into current formally provable paradigms. In order to build systems that robustly behave well, one currently needs to decide what <i>good</i> behavior means in each application domain. This ethical question of good is tied closely to questions of what technologies and engineering techniques are available, how reliable they are, and what trade-offs can be made  all areas where computer science, software engineering, machine learning, and broader AI expertise are valuable. In practical application, a significant consideration is the computational expense of different behavioral standards or ethical theories, i.e. that if a standard cannot be evaluated sufficiently expeditiously to guide behavior in safety-critical situations, cheaper approximations should be used (<a href=\"https://global.oup.com/academic/product/moral-machines-9780195374049\" target=\"_blank\">Wallach and Allen 2008</a>). It is therefore likely best for different complexities of ethical or moral reasoning to be used for different timescales.<br><br>Designing simplified rules, such as those meant to govern a self-driving cars strategic decisions in critical situations, will likely require expertise from both ethicists and computer scientists (<a href=\"http://futureoflife.org/data/documents/research_priorities.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Russell et al. 2015</a>). This is relatively straightforward when specific safety limitations, behaviors, and ethical constraints are known upfront for AI systems that are largely specified upfront (<a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/1602.04450.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Berkenkamp et al. 2016</a>, <a href=\"http://papers.nips.cc/paper/3747-help-or-hinder-bayesian-models-of-social-goal-inference.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Ullman et al. 2009</a>), but more powerful and operationally-flexible systems require much more sophistication. Computational models of ethical reasoning may shed light on questions of computational expense and the viability of reliable ethical reasoning methods (<a href=\"http://www.peterasaro.org/writing/Asaro%20IRIE.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Asaro 2006</a>, <a href=\"http://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007%2Fs13347-011-0043-6.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Sullins 2011</a>). Being able to assure known bounded behaviors from methods and systems that learn will also be important for both medium-term and long-term safety. Validation encompasses ensuring an agent understands its environment, decisions, and actions, and that it acts robustly-in-accordance with its operators' wishes.<br><br>In the long term, AI systems might become much more powerful, general-purpose, and autonomous, a regime where failures of validity would carry significantly higher costs than with today's systems. To maximize the long-term value of validity research, machine learning researchers might focus on anticipating, preventing, detecting, and mitigating the types of otherwise unexpected generalization that would be most problematic for very general and capable AI systems. If some concepts could be learned reliably, it might become possible to use those to define tasks or constraints that minimize the chances of unintended consequences even when agents become very general and capable. This topic has been underexplored, so both theoretical and experimental research on it may be useful (<a href=\"http://futureoflife.org/data/documents/research_priorities.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Russell et al. 2015</a>).",

In addition to generally being more robust and accurate, this inclusion critically helps the agent include the effects of its internal dynamics on the environment. It can also provide a formal grounding for more realistic game theoretic analyses (<a href=\"http://www.auai.org/uai2016/proceedings/papers/87.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Leike et al. 2016</a>).

Identification of the induction problem itself, as analog to Solomonoff induction, in the scenario of an agent both embedded in and computed by its environment, is termed naturalized induction, and can benefit from more research (<a href=\"https://intelligence.org/files/ReflectiveSolomonoffAIXI.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Fallenstein et al. 2015</a>, <a href=\"https://intelligence.org/files/RealisticWorldModels.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Soares 2015</a>, <a href=\"http://lesswrong.com/lw/jd9/building_phenomenological_bridges/\" target=\"_blank\">RobbBB 2013</a>). The agent would need to consider what the possible environments that could be embedding the agent are, and determining a good simplicity prior would help to create a distribution or weighing of those possibilities (<a href=\"http://intelligence.org/files/TechnicalAgenda.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Soares and Fallenstein 2014a</a>).<br><br>Understanding this analog to Solomonoff Induction would help us circumscribe some theoretical limits around such agents. Deficiencies in such capabilities can lead to the type of agent that finds clever ways to seize control of its observation channel, rather than actually identifying and manipulating the features in the world that the reward function was intended to proxy for (<a href=\"https://intelligence.org/files/RealisticWorldModels.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Soares 2015</a>). Determinations of how well an agent does in this regard would require formalizing that question in tandem with developing a scoring metric that evaluates the resulting environment histories, rather than just the agents observations. Some theoretical progress has been made by using reflective oracles to model both agents and their environments, enabling agents to have models of one another and converge to various game theoretic equilibria (<a href=\"https://intelligence.org/files/ReflectiveOraclesAI.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Fallenstein et al. 2015a</a>). Progress has also been made on the \"grain of truth\" problem, such that agents can reason using explicit models of each other without infinite regress (<a href=\"http://www.auai.org/uai2016/proceedings/papers/87.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Leike et al. 2016</a>). Progress in this type of reasoning is also one of the prerequisites to the agent having a theory of open source game theory, useful for designing robust cooperation (<a href=\"http://acritch.com/media/ai/Andrew_Critch_-_Parametric_Bounded_Lob.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Critch 2016</a>).",

As a matter of course, given their training data, machine learning deals with inductive uncertainty in typically narrow contexts. Awareness that insufficient traing data may have been provided for particular determinations supports the developing capability of recognizing ambiguity. Relatedly, determining dimensions or features for which there is little or no data, and which may be important, can be important for proactive ambiguity management (<a href=\"https://intelligence.org/files/ValueLearningProblem.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Soares 2016</a>).

Deep nets can even incorrectly output very different outputs for only trivially different inputs (<a href=\"https://cs.nyu.edu/~zaremba/docs/understanding.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Szegedy et al. 2013</a>).

A variety of different statistical techniques can be employed to detect or mitigate these issues (<a href=\"http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.06565\" target=\"_blank\">Amodei et al. 2016</a>).

A prominent family of algorithms for learning and imitating human behavior, as well as narrow or instrumental values, is inverse reinforcement learning (IRL, <a href=\"https://intelligence.org/files/AlignmentMachineLearning.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Taylor et al. 2016</a>). It attempts to learn the reward function that a human is approximately optimizing (<a href=\"https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~russell/papers/colt98-uncertainty.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Russell 1998</a>, <a href=\"https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~russell/papers/ml00-irl.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Ng and Russell 2000</a>).

IRL has many variants that improve the generality, aggregability, or analysis of the reward function, or the workflow to approaching it (<a href=\"http://jmlr.org/proceedings/papers/v48/finn16.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Finn et al. 2016a</a>). A variant called interactive IRL attempts to learn about the reward function at the same time as trying to maximize it (<a href=\"https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/23843264/Permanent/towards-interactive-inverse-reinforcement-learning.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Armstrong and Leike 2016</a>). Issues with the unidentifiability of the reward function might also be addressable by active IRL (<a href=\"https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/04cf/f669a73c4b6c84124de6e88562cab742c6cb.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Amin and Singh 2016</a>). IRL methods might not scale safely, however, due to their reliance on the faulty assumption that human demonstrators are optimizing for a specific reward function, where in reality humans are often irrational, ill-informed, incompetent, and immoral. Recent work has begun to address these issues (<a href=\"http://stuhlmueller.org/papers/preferences-nipsworkshop2015.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Evans et al. 2015</a>, <a href=\"https://www.aaai.org/Conferences/AAAI/2016/Papers/03Evans12476.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Evans et al. 2015a</a>). Generative adversarial imitation learning is another promising approach to this problem (<a href=\"http://papers.nips.cc/paper/6391-generative-adversarial-imitation-learning.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Ho and Ermon 2016</a>).",

                  "description": "A related verification research topic that is a distinctive long-term concern is the verifiability of systems that modify, extend, or improve themselves, successors, or descendant programs, quite possibly many times in succession (<a href=\"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0065245808604180\" target=\"_blank\">Good 1965</a>, <a href=\"http://www-rohan.sdsu.edu/faculty/vinge/misc/singularity.html\" target=\"_blank\">Vinge 1993</a>, <a href=\"http://arxiv.org/abs/1502.06512\" target=\"_blank\">Yampolskiy 2015</a>). Attempting to straightforwardly apply formal verification tools to this more general setting presents new difficulties (<a href=\"http://futureoflife.org/data/documents/research_priorities.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Russell et al. 2015</a>). With many potential approaches, a formal system that is sufficiently powerful cannot use formal methods in the obvious way to gain assurance about the accuracy of functionally similar formal systems, due to Gödel's incompleteness theorems (<a href=\"https://intelligence.org/files/ProblemsSelfReference.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Fallenstein and Soares 2014</a>, <a href=\"http://arxiv.org/pdf/1312.3626.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Weaver 2013</a>). There has, however, been recent progress in modeling theorem prover verification systems in themselves, specifically illustrated with model polymorphism, cleverly circumventing the Gödellian obstacle (<a href=\"https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~rk436/itp2015a.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Fallenstein and Kumar 2015</a>).",
